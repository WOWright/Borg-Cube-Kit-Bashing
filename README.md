# Borg-Cube-Kit-Bashing

This code is intended to do virtual 'kit bashing'. It assembles pre-defined structures from OpenSCAD into panels, then outputs the resulting structure to an OpenSCAD file for 3D printing. Note that it does not minimize overhangs or ensure that the output is a single structure.

Edges are beveled at 45 degree angles for assembly into a cube.

Borg_Panel_Gen.py is the main file to run. You will need the solidpython library.
